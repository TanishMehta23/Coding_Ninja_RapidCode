## Introduction  
Hello to the person sitting at the other end! ðŸ‘‹  

We decided to create this project (website) not necessarily as an out-of-the-box idea, but rather to take this opportunity to hone our skills in web development and explore further possibilities. This project serves as a learning experience while also being a functional and well-designed website.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** â€“ Structuring the website.  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Adding interactivity.
